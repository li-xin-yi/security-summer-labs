> {sub-ref}`today` | {sub-ref}`wordcount-minutes` min to read

**Attribute-based encryption (ABE)** is a kind of algorithm of public key cryptography in which the private key is used to decrypt data is dependent on certain user attributes such as position, place of residence, type of account [^cryto]. The idea of encryption attribute was first published in [*Fuzzy Identity-Based Encryption*](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~sahai/work/web/2005%20Publications/Eurocrypt2005.pdf) and then developed as [*Attribute-Based Encryption for Fine-Grained Access Control of Encrypted Data*](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~franklin/ecs228/pubs/abe.pdf).
